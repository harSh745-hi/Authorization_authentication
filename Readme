# Backend Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This is a backend service built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.
The project provides a secure authentication system with **Signup**, **Login**, and **Role-based access control (Admin/User)**. 
Middlewares are used to protect routes based on user roles and ensure secure API communication.

---

## 🚀 Features

* User Signup & Login
* Password hashing for security
* JWT-based authentication
* Role-based authorization (User/Admin)
* Structured and scalable project architecture

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* **MongoDB + Mongoose**
* **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
* **Bcrypt**
* **Express Middleware**

---

```

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers with name, email, password, and role.
2. Password is hashed before storage.
3. JWT token is generated on login.
4. Token is required to access protected routes.

## 🧭 APIs & Testing

Below are the routes you can test using **Postman**, **Thunder Client**, or **REST Client**:

---

### 1️⃣ Signup (POST)

```
POST /api/auth/signup
```

**Body**

```json
{
  "name": "Harsh",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "123456",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Login (POST)

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

**Body**

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

**Response**
Returns a JWT token to be used for protected routes.

## 🧠 Middlewares Used

###  `authMiddleware`

* Validates JWT
* Ensures user is logged in


---

## 🗄 Database

Make sure to add your **MongoDB URI** in `.env`:

```
MONGO_URI = your_db_connection_string
JWT_SECRET = your_secret_key
```

---

## 🏁 Run the Project

```
npm install
npm start
```

Server will run on:

```
